## More About Me
- 👶🏻 My first experience  as a developer was around 2001, when I built for fun a website in [HTML tables for page layout before the tableless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tableless_web_design), to show some street arts. Someday I will try to find this code and push it here.
- 🤪 I like to learn a lot of  stuff  besides my working area. I have already completed more than 10 classes on [MasterClass](https://masterclass.com/) from Stand Up Comedy, Creative Writing, Ukulele to Dog Training. Too bad my dogs don't like to learn as much as I do.
- 🤔 I have never  been to college, but I have studied a lot about programming. About ReactJS I have completed the [RocketSeat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/ignite#id-3)  and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) courses. I also want to   take some Kent C. Dodds courses, suchas [EpicReact](https://epicreact.dev/) and [TestingJavaScript](https://testingjavascript.com/), as soon as possible.
